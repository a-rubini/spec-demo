@top Introduction

This document is the user manual for the demonstration package
for the SPEC board.  It explains how to install and build all
the software needed to experience @i{White Rabbit} in your own lab.

Please note that the description here goes to some detail about
rebuilding the software, but most of it can be skipped in a first
reading, if you just need to run the demo without making you hands
dirty.

@chapter Description of the Package

@i{White Rabbit} is a synchronization system designed as an
extension of PTP (@i{Precision Time Protocol}). It is able to achieve
sub-nanosecond accuracy over a multi-level tree of nodes.

SPEC, the @i{Simple PCI-Express Carrier} is a carrier for FMC cards;
it is able to run the @i{White Rabbit} engine to drive the I/O
mezzanine cards with accurate time stamps. The SPEC included in the
demo package is equipped with a 5-channel digital I/O card.

The @i{White Rabbit Switch}, part of the demo package, is a Gigabit
switch for fiber links using SFP transceivers, running White Rabbit
as either a master or a slave. In the demo package it is used as
a master, with the SPEC acting as a slave.

@c ##########################################################################
@node Ethernet Wiring, Booting The Switch, Description of the Package, Top
@chapter Ethernet Wiring

To achieve synchronization of the two systems, the asymmetry of
signalling must be taken care of.  The SPEC and switch should be
connected with a single-mode fiber. The software shipped for the demo
package includes configuration settings for this configuration:

@itemize
@item The @b{violet} SFP transceiver must be plugged in the @code{UP0}
or @code{UP1} ports of the switch. Fine calibration is not yet
supported on the other ports.

@item The @b{blue} SFP transceiver must be plugged in the SPEC card
(which in turn is plugged in a 4-lane PCI-E slot of a GNU/Linux host).
@end itemize

If you swap the transceivers nothing dramatic is going to happen, but
the two nodes won't synchronize correctly (the error depends on the length
of your fiber).

@node Booting The Switch, Running the SPEC, Ethernet Wiring, Top
@chapter Booting The Switch

The @i{White Rabbit Switch} runs a GNU/Linux system in the control
processor, while the WR core is implemented in FPGA. The control
processor loads the FPGA and runs the WR-PTP protocol.

@c ==========================================================================
@node Booting Options, Using the Shipped SD card, Booting The Switch, Booting The Switch
@section Booting Options

To boot the switch, you can use either @i{bootp} and @i{tftp} or the
micro-SD card.  While network boot is preferred during development,
we suggest using the SD card to run the demo (the switch is already
shipped with a card inside).

@c ==========================================================================
@node Using the Shipped SD card, Using a New SD Card, Booting Options, Booting The Switch
@section Using the Shipped SD card

When you received the kit, there was a micro-SD card in the switch.
You'll most likely want to update it with the archive called
@code{wrsw-filesystem.tar.gz}. The archive is a 6.5MB tar file and can
be downloaded from the @i{files} section of the @i{White Rabbit Switch
Software} OHWR project. The direct link while this is edited is
@url{http://www.ohwr.org/attachments/download/675/wrsw-filesystem.tar.gz},
but you may find an updated version in the @i{files} section of the
OHWR project.

You should remove the top cover of the switch; you'll need to remove
4 screws, and you can even leave it open during operation.
The micro-SD card is plugged in a slot within the switch PCB:
it is marked with a green circle
in the photograph below:
@sp 1
@center @image{sd-card, 10cm}
@sp 1
The card has two partitions, you should mount the second partition (which
is formatted with @i{ext2}) and overwrite it with the @i{tar} file.
If your system auto-mounted the partition, you need to skip the first
command and figure what is the mount point that has been created
(to be used in place of @code{/mnt}).

@example
   mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt
   tar -C /mnt -xvzf wrsw-filesystem.tar.gz
   umount /mnt
@end example

Finally, put the card back in the switch and power it up.

If you just need to run the demo (as opposed to be more involved
in development) you may jump over the rest of the chapter and go to
@ref{Running the SPEC}.


@c ==========================================================================
@node Using a New SD Card, Network Boot, Using the Shipped SD card, Booting The Switch
@section Using a New SD Card

If you have the switch and want to use your own card, you need to
create two partitions in it; the first being a thin @i{fat} and the
second being @i{ext2}.  The reason for this is that the internal ROM
of the control CPU can only boot from a @i{fat} partition, which is
however unusable to host a real Unix system.

Unfortunately, the ROM is quite picky about the layout of the @i{fat}
filesystem; creating the right filesystem is mainly a matter of luck,
so Tomasz Wlostowski published an already
made image of the whole card. Here are his instructions:

@itemize @bullet
@item Download @url{http://svn.ohwr.org/white-rabbit/trunk/hdl/bin/sdimage.bz2};
@item Take a microSD card up to 2 GB (it must be a micro-SD card, SDHC cards
won't work);
@item Write the image onto the card (as root): @code{bzcat sdimage2.bz2 >
/dev/YOUR_SD_CARD_DEVICE}. The device is usually @code{/dev/mmcblkX} or
@code{/dev/sdX}. Note that this is an image of an entire card (not a single partition).
@item Be careful and don't accidentally erase your hard drive.
@item Insert the card into the slot on the main board of the switch.
@end itemize

This tricky stuff ``just works'' and is not going to be cleaned up,
as V3 of the WR Switch won't use the SD card nor even the same CPU.
Anyway, if you are interested, complete sources are available at
@url{http://twlostow.web.cern.ch/wr/boot-sd.tar.bz2} (please note it's
32MB, as the procedure involves a complete @i{barebox} boot loader,
so the sources of it all are included).


@c ==========================================================================
@node Network Boot, Connecting to the Switch, Using a New SD Card, Booting The Switch
@section Network Boot

If you are involved in @i{White Rabbit} you'll surely be interested in
network boot of the switch.  When no SD card is found, the CPU ROM
boots from an internal flash where a boot loader has been installed
during production.  So you can just remove the SD card and the system
will use the usual @i{bootp}/@i{tftp} sequence; please note that you
need to have the respective servers installed and configured in your
network.

The network cable being used for boot is the 100Mb interface of the
control CPU, available as RJ45 on the front panel of the switch (you
can see a white UTP cable plugged to it in the previous photograph).

The boot loader will download from the net the following files:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{uImage} (the kernel image, encapsulated for @i{u-boot});
@item @code{ramdisk.ext2} (the filesystem; either a compressed @i{ext2}
image or an @i{initramfs} -- the latter is preferred)
@end itemize

To run the demo, you'll most likely want to use the same
@code{wrsw-filesystem.tar.gz} that you would place in the internal SD
card. To turn the @i{tar} file into an @i{initramfs}, run the
following commands as root:

@example
   mkdir untar-fs
   cd untar-fs
   tar -xzf ../wrsw-filesystem.tar.gz
   find . -print | cpio -o -H newc | gzip > ../ramdisk.ext2
@end example

As explained, @i{ramdisk.ext2} is not an @i{ext2} filesystem, but it's the
name that the boot-loader has been requesting since the initial port.

When booting from the network you'll most likely want to have a serial
console connected to the device, as described next.

@c ==========================================================================
@node Connecting to the Switch,  , Network Boot, Booting The Switch
@section Connecting to the Switch

If you are going to develop with the switch, you'll need to interact
with its command line. Two channels are available: the serial console
(for which you need a flat cable and a level converter) and the 100Mb
network interface.

The control CPU runs an @i{ssh} server, where you can login as
@code{root} with an empty password -- at least this is the
configuration in the demo and development setup.

Please note that the switch asks for an IP addres through DHCP, so the
address being shown in the example below belongs to my local LAN
address range; missing a serial port, you can retrieve the IP address
from the log files in your DHCP server. It's worth noting that V3
of the switch will have an easily accessible UART port.

As usual, you'll need to manually confirm you trust the remote system
when you connect the first time:

@smallexample
   rudo% ssh root@@192.168.16.224
   The authenticity of host '192.168.16.224 (192.168.16.224)'

   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
   Warning: Permanently added '192.168.16.224' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

   wru1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 02:4A:BC:00:00:21
@end smallexample

As you see, the system has configured 4 @i{White Rabbit} ports -- but
remember to plug your fiber to one of the @i{uplink} ports, as
explained in @ref{Ethernet Wiring}.

If you have a serial console, you'll see something like the following
during a successful system boot:

@chapter Running the SPEC

The SPEC card must be plugged in a 4-lane or larger PCI-Express slot, in a
GNU/Linux host. It will appear in @i{lspci} as follows:

@example
   03:00.0 Non-VGA unclassified device: Device 1a39:0004 (rev 01)
@end example

The exact bus number (here ``@code{03}'' will be different on your host,
but that's irrelevant.

To run the WR software suite, you must perform two steps: loading a
Linux driver in the host OS and then loading the FPGA bitstream through
the driver.  Such a bitstream includes an LM32 soft-core which runs its
own embedded WRPTPD executable, which spits diagnostic messages to a serial
port.

The following image shows the card. The red circle identifies the USB
connector (the serial port for diagnostics); the yellow circle shows the
jumper I'll refer to in a while.

@c ==========================================================================
@node The Kernel Driver, The FPGA Binary, Running the SPEC, Running the SPEC
@section The Kernel Driver

The device driver you need is for the @i{Gennum GN4124} PCIe-to-localbus
bridge.  The GN name suggested the @i{gnurabbit} name for the package.

Unfortunately, no binary can be shipped for this driver as you need
to recompile it for the specific kernel version that you are running.

The package, with documentation, can  be downloaded with @i{git}
from @url{git://gnudd.com/gnurabbit.git} or
@url{git://github.com/a-rubini/gnurabbit.git}, or as
a @i{tar} file from
@url{http://www.ohwr.org/attachments/download/673/gnurabbit-2011-07-27.tar.gz}.

Follow the instructions to compile it (subdirectory @code{doc}), which
can be summarized as:

@example
   export LINUX=/path/to/your-kernel
   make
@end example

(Please ignore any errors about documentation: the package relies on
@TeX{} and other packages being available on the host system, but you may
well not have installed them).

Load the kernel module as superuser:

@example
   insmod kernel/rawrabbit.ko
@end example

The driver will try to load a firmware file, but you most likely
won't have it installed, this is correct and you'll see that in the
kernel messages; loading should succeed in any case.
The last lines of kernel message after a successful load are the following:

@smallexample
   rr_loader_complete: called with preempt_cont == 0x00000000
   rr_loader_complete: current = 2753: firmware/rrabbi
   rr_loader_complete: no firmware
@end smallexample

@b{Warning:} you may get an @code{EINVAL} error (i.e. -22) like shown
below. If you have no such error, feel free to skip to @ref{The FPGA
Binary}.

@example
   rawrabbit 0000:02:00.0: device not available
       (can't reserve [mem 0x00000000-0x000fffff 64bit])
   rawrabbit: probe of 0000:02:00.0 failed with error -22
   rr_fill_table_and_probe: Warning: no device found
@end example

The reason for this error is a BIOS (or Linux) failure in enumerating
the device.  You can verify it by running @code{lspci -v} as
superuser: a properly enumerated device looks like this:

@example
   02:00.0 Non-VGA unclassified device: Device 1a39:0004 (rev 01)
        Subsystem: Device 1a39:0004
        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 10
        Memory at fd300000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=1M]
        Memory at fd200000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=1M]
        Memory at fd1ff000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
@end example

while a mis-enumerated device will look like this:

@example
   02:00.0 Non-VGA unclassified device: Device 1a39:0004 (rev 01)
        Subsystem: Device 1a39:0004
        Flags: fast devsel
        Memory at <unassigned> (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [disabled]
        Memory at <unassigned> (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [disabled]
        Memory at <unassigned> (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [disabled]
@end example

If you experience this @code{can't reserve} error, you may try to reset
the Gennum chip by plugging the 2.54mm jumper near the SFP receptacle
(as marked by the yellow circle in the previous photograph) and booting.
This jumper forces a sane boot configuration for the Gennum chip. After
boot, the jumper must be removed before loading the bitstream.

@c ==========================================================================
@node The FPGA Binary, Diagnostic Messages, The Kernel Driver, Running the SPEC
@section The FPGA Binary

The FPGA binary bitstream for the SPEC is currently loaded through
a user-space program (the kernel space firmware-loader needs to be
validated after we sort out some other hardware problems).

The @i{bitstream} to be loaded is @code{spec_top.bin}; the file can be
downloaded from Tomasz' pages as
@url{http://twlostow.web.cern.ch/twlostow/wr/spec_top.bin}.  You can
load it to the SPEC with the following commands, as a superuser running
from the top-level @i{gnurabbit} directory:

@example
   ./user/loadfile spec_top.bin
@end example

The command will take up to 3 seconds. After that, the embedded
WRPTPD will be running in the SPEC itself.

@c ==========================================================================
@node Diagnostic Messages,  , The FPGA Binary, Running the SPEC
@section Diagnostic Messages

The CPU inside the spec runs an embedded WRPTPD, which spits diagnostic
messages to its own serial port. The SPEC includes a serial-usb converter,
so you can plug a mini-usb cable to a USB port of the same computer.

You'll need the @code{cp210x} driver in your host system; this is normally
shipped as an auto-loaded kernel module by all distributions, but if
recompiled your own kernel you'll need to add it to the configuration.
The configuration symbol is @code{CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_CP210X}, enabled
by @code{CONFIG_USB_SERIAL}.

You can run a communication program at the usual 115200,8N1 configuration
and see diagnostic messages. Please note that no message appears
before the link on the fiber is detected. 

A normal run will show the following messages:

@example

@node Demo Results, Troubleshooting, Running the SPEC, Top
@chapter Demo Results

After the two WRPTPD programs (one running on the switch and one
running on the SPEC card) synchronize, you can measure the offset
the respective clocks signals with a scope.

On the switch, you should plug a cable to the output labelled ``PPS''
on the metal case. This is the ``pulse per second'' signal, a positive
pulse lasting 800us at the beginning of each TAI (or UTC) second -- in
this case we are using no external master clock, so it will be a local
reference disconnected from reality.@footnote{The careful reader will
have noticed that the UART messages shown refer to September 28th 2010,
when the SPEC didn't yet exist.}

@center @image{spec-outside,5cm}

On the SPEC, a similar PPS signal is output on the first digital
output channel, which you can look at by plugging a cable. The
photograph above shows the SPEC with the optical fiber (yellow)
and PPS cable (brown).

Your scope, then, will show that the two PPS are well aligned, thanks to
WRPTPD. The following image shows a scope screen-short with a horizontale
scale of 200ns per square.

@end menu

@c ==========================================================================
@node Check the Fiber and Transceivers, Replace the LM32 Program, Troubleshooting, Troubleshooting
@section Check the Fiber and Transceivers

If the SPEC gives no sign of life, maybe it's because no network link
is detected.  If the fiber is too short, the link may not established
because the optical transceivers are saturated.

You may need to get a longe fiber or make a few knots (1cm in
diameter: not less or the fiber may break) to increase attenuation.

In any case, you can always verify if the optical part of the system
works by connecting ports UP0 and UP1 of the switch, using the same
fibers and the same transceivers you'd use to talk with the SPEC.

If the system works, you'll see the ``@code{Link up}'' messages in the
kernel messages of the switch (for example, run ``@code{cat
/proc/kmesg | grep ink}'' in one of your @i{ssh} sessions).

If no @i{link up} message shows, then the problem lies in the optical
part of the link. If the loopback connection works, you can count on it
working towards the SPEC as well.

@c ==========================================================================
@node Replace the LM32 Program, Stick to Precompiled Binaries, Check the Fiber and Transceivers, Troubleshooting
@section Replace the LM32 Program

The program that is part of the shipped @code{spec_top.bin} is silent
until the link goes up.  So even if you look at the USB-serial port of
the SPEC, you won't know whether or not the FPGA has been properly
programmed.  This is a bug on our side, that will be fixed in a later
release.

If the FPGA is properly programmed, you can replace the LM32 program
without doing complete FPGA reprogramming.  The
@code{wr-core-software} repository (@ref{Rebuilding from Source Files}
includes a re-loader wich simply puts the soft-core in reset and
replaces it's RAM image before releasing the reset signal.  The
program is called @code{zpu-loader} because initially the spec was
running a ZPU soft core.  To build it, just get the repository and
compile the tools

@example
    make -C tools
@end example

@noindent
If you load the file @code{wrc-verbose.bin} (committed as part of this
@i{spec-demo} source package, you'll get a much more verbose version
of the SPEC, but even if no link is there these messages will appear
in the serial console:

@example
    ptpd_netif_init
    ptpd_netif_extsrc_detection
    ptpd_netif_create_socket
    read_phase_val
    ptpd_netif_get_hw_addr
    after state=3, wrState=9
@end example

@noindent
To send the new binary to the SPEC you can do like this:

@example
    ~/wr-core-software-tools/zpu-loader ~/spec-demo/wrc-verbose.bin
@end example

related repositories) there may be some minor but details that are not
immediately grasped. On the other hand, it may happen that the demo is
not compiled from the @i{master} branch of the repository.

Therefore, before you try running your remopiled binaries, whether on
the switch or on the SPEC, you'd better ensured the shipped binaries
work at your site.  If they do, then we can help in sorting out what
is going differently in your recompiled binaries.

Please remember this is a demo and the project is still under
development; moreover, this is vacation time in most of Europe so
thinkgs won't change much in the next month.

@node Summary of Files Used in the Demo, Rebuilding from Source files, Troubleshooting, Top
@chapter Summary of Sofware and Hardware

This is the complete list of data and material you need to run the demo
in your lab.

@itemize @bullet
@item The White Rabbit Switch, version 2.
@item A micro-SD card, not from the high-capacity family.
@item The filesystem for the switch, to be put in the micro-SD or TFTP.
@item A roll of fiber to connect the switch and the SPEC. This fiber should be
long enough so that its attenuation guarantees that the optical
receiver is not overdriven by the optical emitter. The shipped SFP
modules are relatively powerful because they are meant to drive 10 km
links. For more information check the specifications on the web.
@item Two optical SFP transceivers: 1310nm (blue) and 1490nm (violet).
@item The SPEC with its digital I/O mezzanine board.
@item A PCI-E PC running a recent kernel version (e.g. 2.6.35, 2.6.39).
@item The compiler, module utils and @i{minicom} from your distribution.
@item The @i{gnurabbit} device driver and 
@item the @code{spec_top.bin} binary file.
@item An USB to mini-USB cable to see diagnostic messages.
@item A coax cable to pick the PPS-OUT from the switch (SMC connector).
@item A coax cable to pick the PPS-OUT from the SPEC I/O mezzanine (LEMO connector).
@item A scope.

The software being used in the demo is all available as source code,
with a Free Software license.  Currently, the various components are
split in several different repositories, as they are being developed
by different groups of people, the situation is still somewhat in flux
toward a more consolidated setup.

The relevant code and documentation is available from the following
repositories, but please check for newer versions of this document at
@url{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/pfc-sw/files/} before starting a
rebuild effort.

@itemize @bullet

@item WRPTPD is currently hosted at @url{git://gnudd.com/ptp-noposix.git}

@item The software for the switch
is at @url{git://ohwr.org/white-rabbit/wr-switch-sw.git} (refers to
WRPTPD during compilation)

@item The SD boot temporary solution is at @url{http://twlostow.web.cern.ch/wr/}

@item The lm32 code base
is at @url{git://github.com/twlostow/wr-core-software.git} (refers to
WRPTPD during compilation)

@item The Linux driver is at @url{git://github.com/a-rubini/gnurabbit.git}

@item The source for this documentation is at
@url{git://github.com/a-rubini/spec-demo.git}; a precompiled PDF is
released in the @i{files} section of the OHWR project

@item The hardware and gateware for the switch is
under SVN at @url{http://svn.ohwr.org/white-rabbit}

@item The hardware and gateware for the SPEC is under git at
@url{git://ohwr.org/hdl-core-lib/wr-cores.git}

@item Documentation about the SPEC is
under SVN at @url{http://svn.ohwr.org/spec}

@chapter Acknowledgments

Most of the work related to the demo package has been performed by
Tomasz Wlostowski with Maciej Lipinski, both in the control group in
the beams department within CERN (Gen@`eve); and Grzegorz Daniluk of
Elproma (Warszawa).

The @i{White Rabbit} project is a multi-company multi-lab
collaboration hosted at @code{ohwr.org}. Many people have been
involved in designing building and running the SPEC and, in
particular, the White Rabbit Switch.
